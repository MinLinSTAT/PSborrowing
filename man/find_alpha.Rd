\title{Calculate Alpha Values from Summary Data}
\usage{
find_alpha(summ, details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{summ}{A data frame containing the summary data. The data frame must
include a \code{stratum} column, where "overall" indicates the overall group and
other values indicate stratified groups.}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with calculated alpha values for both the
overall group and each stratified group. The output includes a \code{stratum} column
indicating the corresponding group.
}
\description{
This function processes a summary data frame (\code{summ}) to calculate alpha values
for both the overall data and stratified groups. It uses the helper function
\code{.find_alpha_Dec9} for the computation.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The input data frame is split into two subsets:
\itemize{
\item \code{no_strat}: Rows with \code{stratum == "overall"}.
\item \code{strat}: Rows with \code{stratum != "overall"}.
}
\item The \code{.find_alpha_Dec9} function is applied to each subset to calculate the alpha values.
\item The results are combined into a single tibble, with \code{stratum} indicating
the group for each set of alpha values.
}
